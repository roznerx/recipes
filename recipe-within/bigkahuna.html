        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <div id="description-text">
            <h3>If memorable enough, food can function as a movie's main character. In Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction there is 
                the classic conversation devoted to the name given a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France, the Royale with Cheese. And 
                who can forget Samuel L. Jackson's harassment of Brett and his friends and the corresponding line “Mmm…this IS a tasty burger.” 
                His salivating inflection alone makes one want to find a fast food joint stat. While watching this movie again it occurred 
                to me that I wished I could have my very own Big Kahuna Burger.
                Now you can too!</h3>

            <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <h3 class="recipe-part">Burger</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef or bison</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grill seasoning</li>
                <li>4 pineapple rings (canned or fresh)</li>
                <li>4 pieces bacon, cooked until crisp</li>
                <li>4 slices monterey jack cheese</li>
                <li>Spicy cilantro mayo</li> 
            </ul>
            <h3 class="recipe-part">Spicy Cilantro Mayo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha or chili sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cilantro, finely chopped </li> 
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="recipe-steps">
            <h2>STEPS</h2> 
            <ol>   
                <li>Using your hands, gently mix the ground meat with the teriyaki and grill seasoning in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Be careful not to overwork the mixture as that can toughen the meat. Divide into four quarter-pound patties.</li>
                <li>Grill pineapple slices for approx 1 minute on each side on your grill of choice.</li>
                <li>Cook burgers until desired doneness on a grill of choice: gas, charcoal or even one from George Foreman's empire all work well.</li>
                <li>Place a piece of bacon on each and then top with a piece of jack cheese to hinge the bacon in place.</li>
                <li>Top with a grilled pineapple slice and serve on Kaiser rolls spread with Spicy Cilantro Mayo.</li>
                <li>Mix all together in a small bowl and use as condiment on Big Kahuna Burgers.</li>
