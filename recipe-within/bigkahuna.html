    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <h3>If memorable enough, food can function as a movie's main character. In Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction there is the classic conversation 
            devoted to the name given a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France, the Royale with Cheese. And who can forget Samuel L. Jackson's harassment 
            of Brett and his friends and the corresponding line “Mmm…this IS a tasty burger.” His salivating inflection alone makes one want to find a 
            fast food joint stat. While watching this movie again it occurred to me that I wished I could have my very own Big Kahuna Burger.
            Now you can too!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Burger</h3>
            <ul>1 pound ground beef or bison</ul>
            <ul>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</ul>
            <ul>1 tablespoon grill seasoning</ul>
            <ul>4 pineapple rings (canned or fresh)</ul>
            <ul>4 pieces bacon, cooked until crisp</ul>
            <ul>4 slices monterey jack cheese</ul>
            <ul>Spicy cilantro mayo</ul>            
        <h3>Spicy Cilantro Mayo</h3>
            <ul>1/3 cup mayonnaise </ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon Sriracha or chili sauce</ul>
            <ul>1 tablespoon cilantro, finely chopped </ul>   
    <h2>Steps:</h2>       
        <ol>Using your hands, gently mix the ground meat with the teriyaki and grill seasoning in a medium bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Be careful not to overwork the mixture as that can toughen the meat. Divide into four quarter-pound patties.</ol>
        <ol>Grill pineapple slices for approx 1 minute on each side on your grill of choice.</ol>
        <ol>Cook burgers until desired doneness on a grill of choice: gas, charcoal or even one from George Foreman's empire all work well.</ol>
        <ol>Place a piece of bacon on each and then top with a piece of jack cheese to hinge the bacon in place.</ol>
        <ol>Top with a grilled pineapple slice and serve on Kaiser rolls spread with Spicy Cilantro Mayo.</ol>
        <ol>Mix all together in a small bowl and use as condiment on Big Kahuna Burgers.</ol>
